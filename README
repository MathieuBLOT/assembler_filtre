# Assembler

Assembler files should have *.asm extension. Hexadecimal and binary values
are NOT supported for immediate values.

The Shift instructions ('SHL' and 'SHR') must have a number appended to them :
to shift 3 times to the left the content of 'R7' into 'R7', you should have written
	SHL3 R7, R7

The generated code will be redirected to stdout, unless you specify a ouput file
(see below).
Then, all that you have to do is to copy/paste the output into vhd/uC/rom.vhd !

Two implementations are proposed, respectively in the subdirectories bash/ and cpp/.
Both programs have been tested, but are given "as-it". Please report us any bug or
error you could find!

CPP : Label friendly
	* Compile sources with "make" into the executable "assembler"
	* Type "./assembler <input_file> <output_file>"
  N.B: 'LI' instructions can be written "LI Rn, Imm" or "LIn Imm" :D

Bash :
	* Make sure you have permission to execute "./assembler.sh"
	  You can do that with the command "chmod +x assembler.sh"
	* Type "./assembler.sh <input_file> <output_file>"
