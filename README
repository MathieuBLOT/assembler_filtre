# Assembler

Assembler files should have *.asm extension.

The Shift instructions ('SHL' and 'SHR') must have a number appended to them :
to shift 3 times to the left the content of 'R7' into 'R7', you should have written
	SHL3 R7, R7

The generated code will be saved in the file "prog.vhd", all that you have to do is to
copy/paste his content into vhd/uC/rom.vhd.

Two implementations are proposed, respectively in the subdirectories bash/ and cpp/.
Both programs have been tested, but are give "as-it". Please report us any bug or
error you could find!

CPP : Label friendly
	* Compile sources with "make" into the executable "assembler"
	* Type "./assembler <path/to/your/code>"
  N.B: 'LI' instructions can be written "LI Rn, Imm" or "LIn Imm" :D

Bash :
	* Make sure you have permission to execute "./assembler.sh"
	  You can do that with the command "chmod +x assembler.sh"
	* Type "./assembler.sh <path/to/your/code>"
