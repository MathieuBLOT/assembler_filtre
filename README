# Assembler

Assembler files must have *.asm extension.
They are excluded from git in .gitignore :)

The Shift instructions ('SHL' and 'SHR') should have a number appended to them :
to shift 3 times to the left the content of 'R7' into 'R7',
you should have written "SHL3 R7, R7"

The generated code will be in the file "prog.vhd"


CPP : Label friendly
	* Compile sources with "make" into the executable "assembler"
	* Type "./assembler <path/to/your/code>"
  N.B: 'LI' instructions can be written "LI Rn, Imm" or "LIn Imm" :D

Bash :
	* Make sure you have permission to execute "./assembler.sh"
	* Type "./assembler.sh <path/to/your/code>"
